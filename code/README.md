Place all required code (all .py or all .java files) in this folder. 

The main program should be in a file/class called Compiler (Compiler.py or Compiler.java)
All Java classes should be in the default package. 

The compiler will be given one argument.  It will be either be a file (ending in .jack) or a directory which contains one or more .jack files to translate.  For example, Square/Main.jack vs. Square. If given a single file, the file should be translated into a corresponding .vm file.  If given a directory, each .jack file in the directory should be processed and converted to a corresponding .vm file.
